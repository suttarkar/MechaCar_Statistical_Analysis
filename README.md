# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* k

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* k

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
